  abstract = {We calculate the complete two-loop corrections to the matrix elements of the fermion mass operator in a general gauge theory. Application to the SU(5) grand unified model shows that higher-order corrections tend to increase the quark masses relative to the results of the lowest-order calculation. Thus consistency between theory and experiment demands at most six flavours.},
