  abstract = {Rigorous bounds on Kl3 spectral functions with up to two substractions are used in order to test the hypothesis mu = 0 Results strongly support an earlier proof, based on a no-subtraction assumption, which shows that the non-renormalization theorem is badly violated if mu= 0. Also, a relation between the Kl3{\textpm} scalar form factor and the quark mass ratio mu/ms is obtained in the soft pion limit. Predictions from this relation are then discussed and compared with other estimates based on the baryon and meson spectra and the {$\eta\rightarrow$}3{$\pi$} decay.},

  abstract = {Quantum chromodynamics has placed the problem of hadronic symmetry breaking on a rational basis. The current-quark mass ratios can be shown to be renormalization-group invariants up to small and controllable corrections from flavor interactions. We calculate the mass ratios of the light {$u$}, {$d$}, and {$s$} quarks using the pseudoscalar-meson mass spectrum, the baryon mass spectrum, and the {$H$} {$\rightarrow$}3⁢{$\pi$} decay. The main theoretical assumptions are that low-lying-resonance and Born terms correctly estimate the photonic contribution to isotopic mass splitting and that chiral perturbation theory---equivalently kaon partial convervation of axialvector current---correctly estimates chiral-symmetry breaking. Taking account of all leading-order chiral corrections to the meson spectrum and from the baryon spectrum and {$H$} {$\rightarrow$}3⁢{$\pi$} decay we obtain {$mumd$} =0.38 {\textpm}0.13 and {$mdms$} =0.045 {\textpm}0.011. We conclude that while a vanishing up-quark mass is not rigorously ruled out it is unattractive from the standpoint of the presently consistent phenomenology of hadronic symmetry breaking.},

A new determination of the current quark mass ratios, including the effects of {$\rho$} -{$\omega$} mixing, then yields {$mumd$} =0.47 {\textpm}0.11 and {$mdms$} =0.042 {\textpm}0.007.},
