	abstract = {Several phenomenological and cosmological aspects of a minimal extension of the Georgi-Glashow model, where the Higgs sector is composed by 5\_H, 15\_H, and 24\_H, are studied. It is shown that the constraints coming from the unification of gauge interactions up to two-loop level predict light scalar leptoquarks. In this GUT scenario, the upper bound on the total proton decay lifetime is tau\_p {\textless} 1.4 x 10{\textasciicircum}36 years. The possibility to explain the matter-antimatter asymmetry in the universe through the decays of SU(2)\_L scalar triplets is also studied. We find that a successful triplet seesaw leptogenesis implies an upper bound on the scalar leptoquark mass, M\_Phib {\textless} 10{\textasciicircum}\{6-7\} GeV. We conclude that this GUT scenario can be tested at the next generation of proton decay experiments and future colliders through the production of scalar leptoquarks.},

	abstract = {We investigate predictions of a minimal realistic non-supersymmetric SU(5) grand unified theory. To accomplish unification and generate neutrino mass we introduce one extra Higgs representation--a 15 of SU(5)--to the particle content of the minimal Georgi-Glashow scenario. Generic prediction of this setup is a set of rather light scalar leptoquarks. In the case of the most natural implementation of the type II see-saw mechanism their mass is in the phenomenologically interesting region (O(10{\textasciicircum}2--10{\textasciicircum}3) GeV). As such, our scenario has a potential to be tested at the next generation of collider experiments, particularly at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN. The presence of the 15 generates additional contributions to proton decay which, for light scalar leptoquarks, can be more important than the usual gauge d=6 ones. We exhaustively study both and show that the scenario is not excluded by current experimental bounds on nucleon lifetimes.},
