  abstract = {An explicit calculation shows perturbation theory to be arbitrarily good for the deep Euclidean Green's functions of any Yang-Mills theory and of many Yang-Mills theories with fermions. Under the hypothesis that spontaneous symmetry breakdown is of dynamical origin, these symmetric Green's functions are the asymptotic forms of the physically significant spontaneously broken solution, whose coupling could be strong.},

  abstract = {A class of non-Abelian gauge theories of strong interactions is described, for which parity and strangeness are automatically conserved, and for which the nonconservations of parity and strangeness produced by weak interactions are automatically of order {$AmW$}2 rather than of order {$A$}. When such theories are "asymptotically free," the order-{$A$} weak corrections to natural zeroth-order symmetries may be calculated ignoring all effects of strong interactions. Speculations are offered on a possible theory of quarks.},
