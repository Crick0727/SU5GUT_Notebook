  abstract = {We examine in detail the possibility of using the Higgs mechanism to remove the catastrophic infrared singularities in non-Abelian gauge theories which are asymptotically free. Our investigation encompasses theories based on SU⁡({$N$}) or O⁡({$N$}) with scalars in one vector, two vector, {$M$} vector, adjoint, tensor, and adjoint plus one vector representations. We find that for these theories an {$S$} matrix, in the perturbative sense, and asymptotic freedom can not coexist. We show that a wide class of Yukawa couplings can be ignored in studying the large-momentum properties of the scalar couplings.},

Yukawa couplings are generally asymptotically free whenever the gauge couplings are, but scalar quartic couplings can be asymptotically free only for simple scalar multiplets in large groups with large fermion content. The infrared behavior of Yukawa and scalar quartic couplings implied by the renormalization group equations has interesting and phenomenologically useful consequences: infrared fixed points (or quasifixed points) lead to bounds on masses of fermions and scalars, while scalar quartic couplings can be driven out of the domain of positivity of the classical potential, with possible implications for patterns of symmetry breaking.},
