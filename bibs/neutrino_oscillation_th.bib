  abstract = {A particle mixture theory of neutrino is proposed assuming the existence of two kinds of neutrinos. Based on the neutrino-mixture theory, a possible unified model of elementary particles is constructed by generalizing the Sakata-Nagoya model. Our scheme gives a natural explanation of smallness of leptonic decay rate of hyperons as well as the subtle difference of G{$\nu$}'s between {\textmu}-e and {$\beta$}-decay.Starting with this scheme, the possibility of Ke3 mode with {$\Delta$}S/{$\Delta$}Q = -1 is also examined, and some bearings on the dynamical role of the B-matter, a fundamental constituent of baryons in the Nagoya model, are clarified.},
