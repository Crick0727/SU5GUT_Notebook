  abstract = {Observations of neutral current neutrino interactions on deuterium in the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory are reported. Using the neutral current, elastic scattering, and charged current reactions and assuming the standard 8B shape, the electron-neutrino component of the 8B solar flux is 1.76 +/-0.05(stat.)+/-0.09(syst.) x10{\textasciicircum}6/(cm{\textasciicircum}2 s), for a kinetic energy threshold of 5 MeV. The non-electron neutrino component is 3.41+/-0.45(stat.)+0.48,-0.45(syst.) x10{\textasciicircum}6/(cm{\textasciicircum}2 s), 5.3 standard deviations greater than zero, providing strong evidence for solar electron neutrino flavor transformation. The total flux measured with the NC reaction is 5.09 +0.44,-0.43(stat.)+0.46,-0.43(syst.)x10{\textasciicircum}6/(cm{\textasciicircum}2 s), consistent with solar models.},

The data exhibit a zenith angle dependent deficit of muon neutrinos which is inconsistent with expectations based on calculations of the atmospheric neutrino flux. Experimental biases and uncertainties in the prediction of neutrino fluxes and cross sections are unable to explain our observation. The data are consistent, however, with two-flavor nu\_mu {$<$}-{$>$} nu\_tau oscillations with sin{\textasciicircum}2(2theta){$>$}0.82 and 5x10{\textasciicircum}-4 {$<$} delta m{\textasciicircum}2 {$<$} 6x10{\textasciicircum}-3 eV{\textasciicircum}2 at 90\% confidence level.},

  abstract = {We present a new global fit of neutrino oscillation parameters within the simplest three-neutrino picture, including new data which appeared since our previous analysis{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}cite\{Forero:2014bxa\}. In this update we include new long-baseline neutrino data involving the antineutrino channel in T2K, as well as new data in the neutrino channel, data from NO\${\textbackslash}nu\$A, as well as new reactor data, such as the Daya Bay 1230 days electron antineutrino disappearance spectrum data and the 1500 live days prompt spectrum from RENO, as well as new Double Chooz data. We also include atmospheric neutrino data from the IceCube DeepCore and ANTARES neutrino telescopes and from Super-Kamiokande. Finally, we also update our solar oscillation analysis by including the 2055-day day/night spectrum from the fourth phase of the Super-Kamiokande experiment. With the new data we find a preference for the atmospheric angle in the upper octant for both neutrino mass orderings, with maximal mixing allowed at \${\textbackslash}Delta{\textbackslash}chi{\textasciicircum}2 = 1.6 {\textbackslash}, (3.2)\$ for normal (inverted) ordering. We also obtain a strong preference for values of the CP phase \${\textbackslash}delta\$ in the range \$[{\textbackslash}pi,2{\textbackslash}pi]\$, excluding values close to \${\textbackslash}pi/2\$ at more than 4\${\textbackslash}sigma\$. More remarkably, our global analysis shows for the first time hints in favour of the normal mass ordering over the inverted one at more than 3\${\textbackslash}sigma\$. We discuss in detail the origin of the mass ordering, CP violation and octant sensitivities, analyzing the interplay among the different neutrino data samples.},
