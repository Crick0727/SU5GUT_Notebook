  abstract = {We study issues arising in attempts to unify strong and other elementary particle interactions. The proton lifetime is estimated in theories with second-order baryon number violation, and found to be O(103--104) longer than naive dimensional counting suggested. The renormalization of quark and lepton masses below the grand unification mass is considered in some detail. Application is made to the SU(5) model of Georgi and Glashow, and we find strange and bottom quark masses: ms {$\approx$} 0.4--0.5 GeV, mb {$\approx$} 4.8--5.6 GeV. Inputs are the values of the strong interactions coupling constant favoured by electroproduction and charmonium analyses, and the observed muon and heavy lepton ({$\tau$}) masses. These estimates are substantially increased if there are more than six flavours of quark. Symmetry breaking in the SU(5) model is studied, including radiative corrections to the effective Higgs potential.},

  abstract = {The natural conservation of flavours to O(GF2) in neutral weak interactions severely constrains choices of gauge groups as well as their fermion representations. In the absence of exactly conserved quantum numbers other than charge, and of {\textbar}{$\Delta$}Q{\textbar} ⩾ 2 charged currents, essentially the only weak and electromagnetic gauge groups whose neutral interactions naturally conserve all flavours are SU(2)L {$\otimes$} U(1) and SU(2)L {$\otimes$} [U(1)]2. The plausible extensions of these gauge groups to grand unified models including the strong interactions are based on SU(5) and SO(10) respectively. Making the SU(5) model completely natural, including in the Higgs sector, gives the prediction md/me ⋍ ms/m{$\mu$} ⋍ mb/m{$\tau$} ⋍ 2605 where {$\tau$} is the probable new heavy lepton and b is the conjectured third flavour of charge -13 quark. The SO(10) model contains a potential SU(2)L {$\otimes$} SU(2)R {$\otimes$} U(1) weak and electromagnetic gauge group, and has a complicated Higgs structure which does not naturally conserve quark flavours.},
