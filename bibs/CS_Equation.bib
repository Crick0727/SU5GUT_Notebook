  abstract = {We use scalar-field perturbation theory as a laboratory to study broken scale invariance. We pay particular attention to scaling laws (Ward identities for the scale current) and find that they have unusual anomalies whose presence might have been guessed from renormalization-group arguments. The scaling laws also appear to provide a relatively simple way of computing the renormalized amplitudes of the theory, which sidesteps the overlapping-divergence problem.},

  abstract = {For infinitesimal changes of vertex functions under infinitesimal variation of all renormalized parameters, linear combinations are found such that the net infinitesimal changes of all vertex functions are negligible relative to those functions themselves at large momenta in all orders of renormalized perturbation theory. The resulting linear first order partial differential equations for the asymptotic forms of the vertex functions are, in quantum electrodynamics, solved in terms of one universal function of one variable and one function of one variable for each vertex function whereby, in contrast to the renormalization group treatment of this problem, the universal function is obtained from nonasymptotic considerations. A relation to the breaking of scale invariance in renormalizable theories is described.},

  abstract = {A previously described method to obtain the asymptotic forms of vertex functions at large momenta is, with the help of Wilson operator product expansion formulas, extended to momenta where the vertex functions of the zero-mass theory underlying the asymptotic forms are infrared singular. To obtain from asymptotic forms information on asymptotic behaviour requires assumptions on the behaviour of the zero-mass theory in the limit of infinite dilatation. One particular set of assumptions is discussed and found to pass a simple consistency test; this set of assumptions leads to power laws, or slight modifications thereof, with coupling-constant-independent exponents. The detailed discussion is given for the {\cyrchar\cyrf}4 model.},
